# 10 — pandas and SQL: Module Outline

## Audience
Undergrad CS and data science majors with Python, pandas, and groupby experience (modules 06–09); no prior SQL or relational database exposure.

## Dataset

| Dataset | Source | Used in | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gapminder | jennybc/gapminder GitHub (TSV) | 10.1–10.7 | Same dataset from module 09; split into two tables to motivate JOIN |

Every notebook is self-contained: each loads Gapminder from the source URL in its first code cell so it can be opened on its own through its Colab badge. Notebooks 10.2–10.7 additionally rebuild the in-memory SQLite database from that load at the start of the notebook, since an in-memory database never persists between sessions.

The split into `countries` (142 × 2) and `measurements` (1704 × 5) is artificial but models real relational database design, where redundant data is stored once and joined when needed. A `sqlite3` in-memory database is recreated in each notebook's setup cell.

## Notebooks

| Notebook | Topic | Main Tools |
|---|---|---|
| 10.1 | `df.query()` | Multi-condition query strings, `@variable` injection, `in` / `not in` lists |
| 10.2 | SQLite Setup | `sqlite3.connect(":memory:")`, `to_sql()`, `pd.read_sql()`, `SELECT`, `LIMIT`, `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, `AS` |
| 10.3 | `WHERE` | `=`, `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE` |
| 10.4 | `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` | `COUNT(*)`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` |
| 10.5 | `JOIN` | `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `ON`, table aliases, NULL detection |
| 10.6 | SQL vs pandas | Subqueries, `WHERE col > (SELECT ...)`, when to use each tool, two-step workflow |
| 10.7 | Exercises | All module 10 tools |

## Growing Translation Table
The SQL-pandas translation table accumulates across notebooks: 7 rows in 10.2, 11 rows in 10.3, 18 rows in 10.4, 22 rows in 10.5, 25 rows in 10.6. Students see the same reference artifact grow with each new concept added to the vocabulary.

## What Is Intentionally Excluded
- Window functions (`OVER`, `PARTITION BY`) — the SQL equivalent of `transform()`; too advanced for this module
- CTEs (`WITH` clause) — out of scope
- Database design and normalization theory
- `RIGHT JOIN` and `FULL OUTER JOIN` — rare in analytical practice; rewrite as `LEFT JOIN` with tables swapped
- Non-SQLite database connections (PostgreSQL, MySQL) — noted as portable but not demonstrated
- `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` — DML is out of scope; this module is read-only analytics
- Query optimization and indexing

## Learning Sequence
Python-side query syntax (10.1) → SQLite setup and SELECT (10.2) → WHERE filtering (10.3) → GROUP BY aggregation and HAVING (10.4) → JOIN across tables (10.5) → subqueries and SQL vs pandas comparison (10.6) → exercises (10.7)
